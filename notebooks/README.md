# Notebooks

This folder contains several notebooks in order to show how you can use the `plan4grid` Python package.
You should look at them in the following order:

1. `one_time_step_1.ipynb`
2. `one_time_step_2.ipynb`
3. `lookahead.ipynb`

Note: *the `assets` subdirectory is here to store the images displayed in the notebooks*.
